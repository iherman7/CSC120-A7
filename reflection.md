- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

Inheritance allows us to create similar classes with small differences without using too much repetitive code. The Building class let us set attributes and methods that would be applied across all kinds of buildings. Therefore, it was easier to inherit those features when creating different types of buildings.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I struggled with the constructor and the syntax of inheritance. I would advise someone taking this course in the future to look at examples, read the readme closely, and review the slides when completing this assignment.
